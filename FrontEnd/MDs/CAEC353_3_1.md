To solve this problem, I'll break it down into steps and explain each part:

a) Finding the new price when price elasticity of demand is -1:

Step 1: Calculate the initial and final quantities
Initial quantity (Q1) = 80 units
Final quantity (Q2) = 100 units

Step 2: Set up the equation using the price elasticity of demand formula:
-1 = (Q2 - Q1) / (P1 * Q1) * (P2 - P1) / (P1 + P2)

Step 3: Plug in the known values:
-1 = (100 - 80) / (4 * 80) * (P2 - 4) / (P2 + 4)

Step 4: Simplify the equation:
-1 = 20 / 320 * (P2 - 4) / (P2 + 4)

Step 5: Solve for P2:
(P2 - 4) / (P2 + 4) = -160 / 320
(P2 - 4) / (P2 + 4) = -0.5

Cross multiply:
P2 - 4 = -0.5P2 - 2

Add 0.5P2 to both sides:
1.5P2 = 2

Divide by 1.5:
P2 = 4/3 ≈ 1.33

Therefore, the new price of the goods is approximately Rs. 1.33 per unit.

b) Calculating the quantity sold at Rs. 6 per unit:

Step 1: Given information:
Price elasticity of supply = 5
Current price (P1) = Rs. 5 per unit
New price (P2) = Rs. 6 per unit
Quantity sold at P1 = 500 units

Step 2: Set up the equation using the price elasticity of supply formula:
5 = (Q2 - Q1) / (P1 * Q1) * (P2 - P1) / (P1 + P2)

Step 3: Plug in the known values:
5 = (Q2 - 500) / (5 * 500) * (6 - 5) / (6 + 5)

Step 4: Simplify the equation:
5 = (Q2 - 500) / 2500 * 1 / 11

Step 5: Solve for Q2:
(Q2 - 500) / 2500 = 55 / 110
(Q2 - 500) / 2500 = 0.5

Multiply both sides by 2500:
Q2 - 500 = 1250

Add 500 to both sides:
Q2 = 1750

Therefore, the producer will sell 1750 units at the price of Rs. 6 per unit.

Key points to consider:
1. In part (a), we used the price elasticity of demand formula to find the new price.
2. In part (b), we used the price elasticity of supply formula to find the new quantity.
3. Both formulas involve percentage changes, which simplifies the calculations.
4. The negative sign in the price elasticity of demand formula is ignored when interpreting the result.

These problems demonstrate how price elasticity can be used to analyze market responses to price changes and make predictions about future market behavior.
