Delegation of authority is a process in which a manager transfers some of their authority to subordinates. This process allows managers to distribute responsibilities, share decision-making authority, and empower employees to take ownership of their work. Delegation is a key management tool that enables managers to manage their teams more effectively, ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently and that employees are engaged and motivated.

### Major Features of Delegation of Authority:

1. **Balance of Authority and Responsibility**: One of the key features of delegation is the balance between the authority given and the responsibility taken. When authority is delegated, it is important that the responsibility that comes with it is also delegated. This ensures that the subordinate understands the importance of the task and is accountable for its completion.

2. **Absoluteness of Authority**: The authority delegated must be clear and absolute. This means that the subordinate has the authority to make decisions within the scope of the delegated authority. However, they should not have the authority to make decisions outside of this scope. This clarity helps prevent confusion and ensures that the delegated authority is used effectively.

3. **Specificity of Authority**: The authority delegated should be specific and well-defined. This means that the subordinate should know exactly what they are authorized to do and what they are not. Specificity helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures that the delegated authority is used appropriately.

4. **Continuity of Authority**: The authority delegated should be continuous, meaning that it remains valid until the task is completed or until the manager revokes it. This continuity ensures that the subordinate has the necessary authority to carry out the task without interruption.

5. **Accountability**: When authority is delegated, the subordinate becomes accountable for the outcomes of their actions. This means that they are responsible for ensuring that the task is completed correctly and efficiently. Accountability ensures that the delegated authority is used responsibly and effectively.

6. **Feedback and Review**: Delegation should include a mechanism for feedback and review. This allows the manager to assess the effectiveness of the delegated authority and to provide guidance or corrective action as needed. Feedback and review help ensure that the delegated authority is being used effectively and that any issues are addressed promptly.

In summary, delegation of authority is a critical management tool that allows managers to distribute responsibilities, share decision-making authority, and empower employees. The major features of delegation include the balance of authority and responsibility, the absoluteness and specificity of authority, the continuity of authority, accountability, and the provision for feedback and review. By understanding and effectively applying these features, managers can delegate authority in a way that enhances productivity, engagement, and overall organizational success.
