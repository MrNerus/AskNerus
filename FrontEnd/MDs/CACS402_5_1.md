MapReduce is a powerful programming model used for processing large data sets in parallel across a cluster of computers. It's particularly effective for handling massive amounts of data in distributed computing environments.

###  Core Components

1. **Map Phase**  - Takes input data and breaks it into key-value pairs
  - Processes data in parallel across multiple nodes
  - Creates intermediate results for further processing


2. **Reduce Phase**  - Aggregates the output from map phase
  - Combines values for each key
  - Produces final output

The diagram illustrates the MapReduce processing flow, where:

- Pink represents input data
- Green shows the parallel map operations
- Blue indicates the shuffle phase where data is redistributed
- Yellow shows the final reduce operations producing output
