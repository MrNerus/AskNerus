Here's a UDP client and server socket program where the server identifies whether the number sent by the client is even or odd and replies accordingly:

### UDP Server

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class EvenOddServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            DatagramSocket serverSocket = new DatagramSocket(8888);
            System.out.println("Even/Odd server started on port 8888");

            byte[] receiveBuffer = new byte[1025];
            DatagramPacket receivePacket = new DatagramPacket(receiveBuffer, receiveBuffer.length);

            while (true) {
                serverSocket.receive(receivePacket);
                String message = new String(receivePacket.getData()).trim();
                int number = Integer.parseInt(message);

                if (number % 2 == 0) {
                    String response = "Even";
                } else {
                    String response = "Odd";
                }

                byte[] sendBuffer = response.getBytes();
                DatagramPacket sendPacket = new DatagramPacket(sendBuffer, sendBuffer.length,
                        receivePacket.getAddress(), receivePacket.getPort());
                serverSocket.send(sendPacket);

                System.out.println("Sent response: " + response);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### UDP Client

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class EvenOddClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
            DatagramSocket clientSocket = new DatagramSocket();
            InetAddress serverAddress = InetAddress.getByName("localhost");
            int port = 8888;

            while (true) {
                System.out.print("Enter a number (or 'exit' to quit): ");
                String input = scanner.nextLine().trim();
                if ("exit".equalsIgnoreCase(input)) {
                    break;
                }

                int number = Integer.parseInt(input);

                byte[] sendData = input.getBytes();
                DatagramPacket sendPacket = new DatagramPacket(sendData, sendData.length, serverAddress, port);
                clientSocket.send(sendPacket);

                byte[] receiveData = new byte[1025];
                DatagramPacket receivePacket = new DatagramPacket(receiveData, receiveData.length);
                clientSocket.receive(receivePacket);

                String response = new String(receivePacket.getData()).trim();
                System.out.println("Server response: " + response);
            }

            clientSocket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. Server Program:
   - Creates a `DatagramSocket` listening on port 8888.
   - Continuously receives data from clients.
   - Checks if the received number is even or odd.
   - Sends a response back to the client.
   - Keeps running indefinitely until manually stopped.

2. Client Program:
   - Prompts the user to enter numbers.
   - Sends each number to the server.
   - Receives and displays the server's response.
   - Allows the user to exit the program.

### Key Points

1. UDP is used instead of TCP for faster communication.
2. The server runs continuously, waiting for incoming connections.
3. The client can send multiple requests to the server.
4. Error handling is included for IO operations.
5. The server checks if the received number is even or odd and responds accordingly.

To run this program:
1. Compile both the server and client classes.
2. Run the server first.
3. Run the client to start sending numbers to the server.

Note: This program doesn't include any validation of the input. In a production environment, you would want to add proper error handling and input validation.
