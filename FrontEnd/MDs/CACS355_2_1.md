The InetAddress class is part of Java's networking API and is used to represent Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Here's an explanation of its use and a program to retrieve IP and MAC addresses:

### Use of InetAddress Class

The InetAddress class provides methods to manipulate IP addresses and perform network-related operations. Its main uses include:

1. Representing IP addresses
2. Performing name resolution (converting domain names to IP addresses)
3. Creating sockets for network communication
4. Retrieving information about network interfaces

### Program to Retrieve IP and MAC Addresses

Here's a Java program that retrieves both the IP address and MAC address of the local machine:

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.util.*;

public class NetworkInfo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws UnknownHostException, SocketException {
        // Get IP address
        InetAddress ip = InetAddress.getLocalHost();
        System.out.println("Local Host IP Address: " + ip);

        // Get MAC address
        NetworkInterface networkInterface = NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress(ip);
        byte[] mac = networkInterface.getHardwareAddress();

        if (mac != null) {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            for (int i = 0; i < mac.length; i++) {
                sb.append(String.format("%02X%s", mac[i], (i < mac.length - 1) ? "-" : ""));
            }
            System.out.println("MAC Address: " + sb.toString());
        } else {
            System.out.println("MAC Address could not be retrieved");
        }

        // Get all network interfaces
        Enumeration<NetworkInterface> nis = NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces();
        while (nis.hasMoreElements()) {
            NetworkInterface ni = nis.nextElement();
            System.out.println("\nInterface: " + ni.getName());

            Enumeration<InetAddress> inetAddresses = ni.getInetAddresses();
            while (inetAddresses.hasMoreElements()) {
                InetAddress inetAddress = inetAddresses.nextElement();
                System.out.println("  IP Address: " + inetAddress);
            }

            byte[] hardwareAddress = ni.getHardwareAddress();
            if (hardwareAddress != null) {
                System.out.println("  Hardware Address: " + Arrays.toString(hardwareAddress));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This program does the following:

1. Retrieves the local host IP address using `InetAddress.getLocalHost()`.

2. Gets the MAC address of the local host using `NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress()` and `getHardwareAddress()`.

3. Prints the IP address and MAC address of the local host.

4. Iterates through all network interfaces, printing their names, IP addresses, and hardware addresses.

### Key Points to Consider

1. The `InetAddress` class provides methods for working with IP addresses, including conversion between IP addresses and hostnames.

2. The `NetworkInterface` class is used to retrieve information about network interfaces, including MAC addresses.

3. Getting the MAC address requires root privileges on Unix-like systems, so the program might fail on some systems due to permission issues.

4. The program prints all network interfaces available on the system, which can be useful for debugging network configurations.

### Summary

This program demonstrates the use of the `InetAddress` and `NetworkInterface` classes to retrieve IP and MAC addresses. It showcases how these classes work together to provide comprehensive network information. The program follows best practices by handling exceptions and providing informative output for each network interface found.
