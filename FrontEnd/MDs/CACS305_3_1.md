In 3D computer graphics, geometric transformations are operations that change the position, orientation, or size of objects in a 3D space. These transformations are fundamental to creating and manipulating 3D scenes. The basic geometric transformations in 3D are translation, rotation, and scaling. Each of these transformations can be applied to move, rotate, or resize objects in a 3D space.

### 1. Translation

Translation moves an object from one position to another without changing its orientation or size. It's defined by a vector that specifies the distance to move the object along the x, y, and z axes.

**Example**: To move an object from the origin (0, 0, 0) to the point (3, 2, 1), you would apply a translation of (3, 2, 1).

### 2. Rotation

Rotation changes the orientation of an object around an axis. There are three types of rotations: around the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis. The amount of rotation is specified by an angle, typically in degrees or radians.

**Example**: To rotate an object 45 degrees around the y-axis, you would apply a rotation of 45 degrees around the y-axis.

### 3. Scaling

Scaling changes the size of an object. It can be uniform (scaling the object equally in all dimensions) or non-uniform (scaling the object differently in each dimension).

**Example**: To scale an object uniformly by a factor of 2, you would apply a scaling of (2, 2, 2).

### Implementing 3D Transformations

In practice, 3D transformations are often represented as matrices. Each type of transformation has its own matrix representation. When you apply multiple transformations, you combine their matrices to get the final transformation matrix.

**Example**: To apply a translation of (3, 2, 1) followed by a rotation of 45 degrees around the y-axis, you would first calculate the rotation matrix for the 45-degree rotation and then multiply it by the translation matrix.

Here's a simplified example in pseudo-code:

```python
# Define the translation vector
translation = (3, 2, 1)

# Define the rotation angle (in degrees)
rotation_angle = 45

# Convert the rotation angle to radians
rotation_angle_rad = degrees_to_radians(rotation_angle)

# Calculate the rotation matrix for the y-axis
rotation_matrix = rotation_matrix_y(rotation_angle_rad)

# Calculate the translation matrix
translation_matrix = translation_matrix(translation)

# Combine the matrices
final_matrix = translation_matrix * rotation_matrix

# Apply the final transformation matrix to the object
object.transform(final_matrix)
```

This pseudo-code demonstrates the concept of combining transformations. In actual implementations, you would use a 3D graphics library or engine that provides functions for creating and combining transformation matrices, converting angles, and applying transformations to objects.

Understanding and applying these basic geometric transformations are crucial for creating and manipulating 3D objects in computer graphics.
