The Mid-Point Circle Algorithm is a method used in computer graphics to draw a circle. It is particularly useful for drawing circles on a grid where each cell represents a pixel. The algorithm works by calculating the points of the circle using the mid-point formula and then plotting these points on the grid. The algorithm is efficient and can be easily implemented in programming languages.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**: Choose the center of the circle (x_center, y_center) and the radius (r).

2. **Calculate the initial decision parameter**: The decision parameter (d) is calculated as follows:
   - d = 3 - 2 * r

3. **Plot the initial point**: The first point of the circle is plotted at (x_center + r, y_center).

4. **Iterate through the circle**:
   - For each iteration, the algorithm calculates the next point to plot based on the current decision parameter.
   - If the decision parameter is greater than or equal to 0, it means the next point is on the same y-coordinate as the current point, but on the next x-coordinate. So, plot the point at (x_center + x, y_center + y) and (x_center + x, y_center - y).
   - Update the decision parameter: d = d + 4 * (y - x) + 10.
   - Increment x by 1.
   - If the decision parameter is less than 0, it means the next point is on the same x-coordinate as the current point, but on the next y-coordinate. So, plot the point at (x_center + x, y_center + y) and (x_center - x, y_center + y).
   - Update the decision parameter: d = d + 4 * x + 6.
   - Increment y by 1.

5. **Repeat steps 4 and 5** until x is greater than y.

### Example Implementation in Python

Here's a simple implementation of the Mid-Point Circle Algorithm in Python:

```python
def draw_circle(x_center, y_center, r):
    x = 0
    y = r
    d = 3 - 2 * r

    # Plot the initial point
    print(f"({x_center + x}, {y_center + y})")
    print(f"({x_center + x}, {y_center - y})")

    while x <= y:
        # Decide the next point
        if d >= 0:
            y -= 1
            d = d + 4 * (x - y) + 10
        x += 1
        d = d + 4 * (y - x)

        # Plot the next point
        print(f"({x_center + x}, {y_center + y})")
        print(f"({x_center + x}, {y_center - y})")
        print(f"({x_center - x}, {y_center + y})")
        print(f"({x_center - x}, {y_center - y})")

# Example usage
draw_circle(5, 5, 3)
```

This code defines a function `draw_circle` that takes the center coordinates (x_center, y_center) and the radius (r) as input. It then uses the Mid-Point Circle Algorithm to calculate and print the points of the circle. Note that this example prints the coordinates of the points to the console; in a real application, you would replace these print statements with code to draw the points on a screen or canvas.
