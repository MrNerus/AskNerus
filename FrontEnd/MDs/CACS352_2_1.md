Distributed systems have several distinct characteristics that set them apart from traditional centralized systems. Here are the key characteristics of distributed systems:

1. Concurrency:
   - Multiple processes run simultaneously on different nodes.
   - Allows for parallel processing and improved system responsiveness.

2. Distribution:
   - Components are spread across multiple computers or nodes.
   - No single point of failure due to distributed nature.

3. Transparency:
   - Location transparency: Users interact with the system as if it were centralized.
   - Migration transparency: Components can move between nodes without affecting users.
   - Replication transparency: Multiple copies of data exist without user awareness.

4. Fault tolerance:
   - Ability to continue operation even when components fail.
   - Redundancy and backup systems ensure system availability.

5. Scalability:
   - Can add new nodes easily to increase capacity.
   - Allows for horizontal scaling to meet growing demands.

6. Heterogeneity:
   - Different hardware, software, and communication protocols can coexist.
   - Enables integration of various technologies and platforms.

7. Asynchronous communication:
   - Processes communicate independently, without waiting for responses.
   - Allows for loose coupling between components.

8. Distributed shared memory:
   - Multiple processes share common memory space.
   - Enables concurrent access to shared resources.

9. Consistency:
   - Maintaining consistency across distributed data and resources.
   - Challenges arise due to network latency and failures.

10. Security:
    - Ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of distributed systems.
    - Managing authentication and authorization across nodes.

Best practices:
- Implement proper synchronization mechanisms for shared resources.
- Design for fault tolerance and graceful failure handling.
- Use standardized protocols for inter-node communication.
- Consider performance implications of distributed architecture.

These characteristics define the fundamental nature of distributed systems, enabling flexible, scalable, and robust computing environments.
