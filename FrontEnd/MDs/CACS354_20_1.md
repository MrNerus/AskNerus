Here's an explanation of RMI, stubs, and parameter marshaling, along with a client/server application to find the product of two numbers using RMI:

### RMI (Remote Method Invocation)

RMI is a protocol that allows an object to invoke methods on an object located in another address space, such as an object running in another virtual machine on a separate computer.

Key points about RMI:
- Enables distributed computing
- Objects communicate via stubs/proxies
- Uses serialization for passing objects
- Requires a naming service (usually RMI Registry)

### Stubs

Stubs are proxies that act as intermediaries between the client and the actual remote object. They handle the communication between the client and server.

Key points about stubs:
- Generated automatically by the RMI compiler
- Implement the remote interface on the client side
- Translate method calls to network protocols

### Parameter Marshaling

Parameter marshaling refers to the process of converting the parameters of a method call into a format that can be transmitted over a network.

Key points about parameter marshaling:
- Converts objects to byte streams
- Handles primitive types differently
- May involve serialization

### Client/Server Application Example

Let's create a simple RMI application that finds the product of two numbers:

1. First, let's create the remote interface:

```java
import java.rmi.Remote;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;

public interface ProductCalculator extends Remote {
    long multiply(long a, long b) throws RemoteException;
}
```

2. Now, let's implement the remote object:

```java
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;

public class ProductCalculatorImpl extends UnicastRemoteObject implements ProductCalculator {
    public ProductCalculatorImpl() throws RemoteException {
        super();
    }

    @Override
    public long multiply(long a, long b) throws RemoteException {
        return a * b;
    }
}
```

3. Next, let's create the server:

```java
import java.rmi.registry.LocatedRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;

public class ProductCalculatorServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            ProductCalculator calculator = new ProductCalculatorImpl();
            Registry registry = LocatedRegistry.createRegistry(1099);
            registry.rebind("ProductCalculator", calculator);
            System.out.println("Server ready");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Server exception: " + e.toString());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

4. Finally, let's create the client:

```java
import java.rmi.registry.LocatedRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;

public class ProductCalculatorClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Registry registry = LocatedRegistry.getRegistry("localhost", 1099);
            ProductCalculator calculator = (ProductCalculator) registry.lookup("ProductCalculator");
            
            long a = 5;
            long b = 3;
            
            long product = calculator.multiply(a, b);
            
            System.out.println("Product of " + a + " and " + b + " is: " + product);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Client exception: " + e.toString());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

How this works:

1. The server creates an instance of `ProductCalculatorImpl` and registers it with the RMI registry.
2. The client looks up the remote object from the registry.
3. The client calls the `multiply` method on the remote object.

Key points to note:
- The `UnicastRemoteObject` class is used to export the remote object.
- The `Remote` interface is extended to declare remote methods.
- Exceptions (`RemoteException`) are thrown for remote method calls.
- The RMI registry acts as a naming service for locating remote objects.

This example demonstrates the basic principles of RMI, including stubs (generated automatically), parameter marshaling (handled internally by RMI), and the client-server interaction.
