Here are the key differences between declaration and expression tags in JSP:

1. Purpose:
   - Declaration tag: Declares variables or methods that can be used throughout the JSP file.
   - Expression tag: Evaluates a Java expression and outputs the result as a string.

2. Scope:
   - Declaration tag: Variables/methods are available globally in the JSP file.
   - Expression tag: Only valid within the expression itself.

3. Syntax:
   - Declaration tag: Starts with <%! and ends with %>.
   - Expression tag: Starts with <%= and ends with %>.

4. Output:
   - Declaration tag: Does not produce any output.
   - Expression tag: Produces output by inserting the evaluated expression as a string.

5. Execution:
   - Declaration tag: Code is compiled once and executed for each request.
   - Expression tag: Code is compiled and executed for each request.

Now, let's create a JSP page that meets the requirements:

```jsp
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" %>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Find Greatest Number</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Enter Three Numbers:</h2>
    <form action="" method="post">
        <input type="number" name="num1" placeholder="Number 1"><br><br>
        <input type="number" name="num2" placeholder="Number 2"><br><br>
        <input type="number" name="num3" placeholder="Number 3"><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Find Greatest">
    </form>
    <%
    if(request.getMethod().equals("POST")) {
        double num1 = Double.parseDouble(request.getParameter("num1"));
        double num2 = Double.parseDouble(request.getParameter("num2"));
        double num3 = Double.parseDouble(request.getParameter("num3"));
        
        double max = Math.max(Math.max(num1, num2), num3);
        
        out.println("<p>The greatest number is: " + max + "</p>");
    }
    %>
</body>
</html>
```

This JSP page does the following:

1. Sets the page language to Java and specifies UTF-8 encoding.
2. Creates a simple HTML structure with a title.
3. Includes a form with three input fields for numbers and a submit button.
4. Uses a scriptlet to check if the form was submitted via POST.
5. Retrieves the three numbers from the request parameters.
6. Finds the maximum number using Math.max().
7. Displays the greatest number below the form.

When the user enters three numbers and clicks the "Find Greatest" button, the page will display the greatest number among the three entered.
