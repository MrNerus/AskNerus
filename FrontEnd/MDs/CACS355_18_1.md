Here's a guide on constructing and connecting a ServerSocket in Java, along with explanations of key options:

### Constructing and Connecting a ServerSocket

1. Create a ServerSocket object:
   ```java
   ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(portNumber);
   ```

2. Listen for incoming connections:
   ```java
   Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
   ```

3. Handle the client connection:
   ```java
   try (BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
        BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream()))) {
       // Read and write data to/from the client
   }
   ```

4. Close the sockets:
   ```java
   clientSocket.close();
   serverSocket.close();
   ```

### ServerSocket Options with Examples

1. Binding to a specific address:
   ```java
   ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(portNumber, 50, InetAddress.getByName("192.168.1.100"));
   ```
   This binds the socket to a specific IP address.

2. Setting the reuse address option:
   ```java
   serverSocket.setReuseAddress(true);
   ```
   This allows the socket to be reused even if it hasn't been closed properly.

3. Setting the receive buffer size:
   ```java
   serverSocket.setReceiveBufferSize(8192);
   ```
   This sets the size of the receive buffer.

4. Setting the send buffer size:
   ```java
   serverSocket.setSendBufferSize(8192);
   ```
   This sets the size of the send buffer.

5. Setting the timeout:
   ```java
   serverSocket.setSoTimeout(30000); // 30 seconds timeout
   ```
   This sets a timeout for socket operations.

6. Setting the performance preferences:
   ```java
   serverSocket.setPerformancePreferences(1, 10, 1);
   ```
   This sets performance preferences for the socket (connection time, latency, and bandwidth).

7. Using a custom socket implementation:
   ```java
   serverSocket.setSocketImplFactory(new CustomSocketImplFactory());
   ```
   This allows you to use a custom socket implementation.

8. Setting the linger option:
   ```java
   serverSocket.setSoLinger(true, 10);
   ```
   This enables the linger option and sets its timeout.

Remember to handle exceptions appropriately when working with sockets. Also, consider using try-with-resources statements to ensure proper closure of resources.
