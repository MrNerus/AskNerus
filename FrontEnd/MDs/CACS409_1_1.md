The critical flow model in e-Governance represents a systematic framework that outlines the essential processes and interactions involved in digital governance initiatives. This model helps organizations understand and implement effective e-Governance solutions by identifying key components and their relationships.

The diagram above illustrates the critical flow model's three-layer architecture. The solid arrows show the primary flow of information, while the dotted line represents the continuous improvement cycle where feedback from the output layer informs future inputs. Each layer serves distinct purposes: the Input Layer captures various stakeholder interactions, the Processing Layer handles validation and security, and the Output Layer manages responses and updates.
