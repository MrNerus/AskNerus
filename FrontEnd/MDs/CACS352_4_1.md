A structured naming scheme for entities in a database follows a consistent pattern to make names meaningful, unique, and easy to understand. Here's a brief explanation of a typical structured naming scheme:

1. Prefix:
   - Often indicates the schema or owner of the object
   - Example: "emp_" for employee-related objects

2. Main Name:
   - Describes the primary purpose or content of the entity
   - Should be concise yet descriptive
   - Example: "employee"

3. Suffix:
   - Optional, used for additional categorization
   - Example: "_info", "_details"

4. Special Characters:
   - Avoid special characters except underscores
   - Underscores are commonly used to separate words

5. Length Limitations:
   - Most databases have a maximum length for object names
   - Keep names within the allowed limits

Example of a well-named entity:
```
emp_employee_info
```

Key points:
- Consistency across the entire database
- Follows business terminology
- Avoids ambiguity
- Easy to read and understand

Best practices:
- Document the naming conventions clearly
- Use tools to enforce naming rules
- Review and update naming schemes periodically

A structured naming scheme improves database readability, maintainability, and collaboration among team members.
