Here's a breakdown of income elasticity of demand and its types:

### Definition of Income Elasticity of Demand

Income elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to changes in consumer income. It quantifies how much the demand for a product changes when income levels change, assuming prices remain constant.

Key points to consider:
- It's calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income.
- The formula is: Income Elasticity of Demand = % Change in Demand Quantity / % Change in Income of Consumer

### Types of Income Elasticity of Demand

Income elasticity of demand can be classified into three main categories based on their numerical values:

1. Positive Income Elasticity of Demand
   - Demand increases with income and decreases with decreased income.
   - Examples: Luxury goods, cars, jewelry.

2. Negative Income Elasticity of Demand  
   - Demand decreases with increased income and increases with decreased income[2].
   - Examples: Inferior goods like instant noodles.

3. Zero Income Elasticity of Demand
   - No change in demand quantity despite changes in consumer income[2].
   - Example: Salt.

### Subcategories of Positive Income Elasticity

Within positive income elasticity, there are three subcategories:

1. Unitary Income Elasticity (e_y = 1)
   - Quantity demanded rises equal proportionally to income increase.

2. More than Unitary Income Elasticity (e_y > 1)
   - Quantity demanded rises more than proportionally to income increase.

3. Less than Unitary Income Elasticity (0 < e_y < 1)
   - Quantity demanded rises less than proportionally to income increase.

### Importance of Income Elasticity of Demand

Understanding income elasticity of demand is crucial for businesses and policymakers because:

- It helps predict how changes in income will affect product sales.
- It informs pricing strategies and investment decisions.
- It aids in identifying market trends and opportunities.

In conclusion, income elasticity of demand is a powerful tool for analyzing consumer behavior and market dynamics. By understanding how income affects demand for products, businesses can make informed decisions to optimize their strategies and stay competitive in the market.
