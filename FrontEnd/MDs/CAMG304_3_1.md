Groups in organizations can be categorized into formal and informal groups, each serving different purposes and having distinct characteristics.

### Description of Groups

**Formal Groups** are characterized by their structured nature, defined roles, and clear purpose. They are typically more hierarchical and have a leader or coordinator. Formal groups are essential for the organization's operations and decision-making processes.

**Informal Groups**, on the other hand, are characterized by their flexibility, personal relationships, and shared interests. They often form spontaneously and can be more casual and relaxed than formal groups. Informal groups play a crucial role in the social and emotional well-being of employees, fostering a sense of community and support within the organization.


### Formal Groups

Formal groups are structured and recognized by the organization. They are defined by the organization's formal structure, such as the organizational chart or job descriptions. Formal groups typically have a clear purpose, defined roles, and a leader or coordinator.

**Types of Formal Groups:**

1. **Command Group**: This is a group that has the authority to make decisions and give orders. It often includes managers and executives. For example, a team of project managers responsible for overseeing a large construction project would be considered a command group.

2. **Task Group**: This is a group that is formed to accomplish a specific task or project. The group is usually temporary and disbands once the task is completed. For instance, a team of software developers working on a new software feature would be a task group.

### Informal Groups

Informal groups are not officially recognized by the organization but still exist within the organization. They are often formed based on shared interests, friendships, or common experiences. Informal groups can be more flexible and adaptable than formal groups.

**Types of Informal Groups:**

1. **Interest Group**: This is a group formed around a shared interest or hobby. Members of an interest group often meet outside of work hours to pursue their shared interest. For example, a group of employees who enjoy photography might meet after work to share tips and discuss their latest projects.

2. **Friendship Group**: This is a group formed based on personal relationships among employees. These groups often meet during breaks or lunch to socialize and support each other. For instance, a group of employees who are close friends might meet regularly for lunch to catch up and support each other through work challenges.

In summary, both formal and informal groups play important roles in the organization. Formal groups are essential for the organization's structure and operations, while informal groups contribute to the social and emotional well-being of employees.
