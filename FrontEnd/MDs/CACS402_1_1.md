Cloud computing is a model of delivering computing services over the internet, where resources such as servers, storage, databases, software, and applications are provided as a service to users on-demand 3:0. Instead of having physical infrastructure, organizations can access these resources remotely through web-based interfaces, allowing for flexible scaling and reduced capital expenditures.

Let's visualize how cloud computing works:

The diagram illustrates the three key layers of cloud computing:

1. **Client Access Layer**: Shows how users can access cloud services through various devices and interfaces
2. **Cloud Services Layer**: Represents the core characteristics that define cloud computing
3. **Resource Pool Layer**: Displays the actual computing resources that are managed and delivered

Now, let's examine the key characteristics of cloud computing in detail:

### Essential Characteristics

1. **On-demand Self-service**  - Users can provision computing services automatically without requiring human intervention
  - Resources are available through self-service portals and API calls
  - Eliminates the need for lengthy procurement processes 1:6


2. **Broad Network Access**  - Access resources from anywhere with an internet connection
  - Works across diverse devices (mobile phones, tablets, laptops, desktops)
  - Ensures consistent accessibility regardless of location 1:7


3. **Resource Pooling**  - Multiple customers share physical resources using multi-tenant architecture
  - Resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned based on demand
  - Enables higher utilization rates and reduced waste 1:9


4. **Rapid Elasticity**  - Resources can be quickly scaled up or down based on demand
  - Capabilities are practically unlimited
  - Enables automatic scaling to match workload requirements 1:10


5. **Measured Service**  - Usage is monitored and reported for transparency
  - Pay-per-use model based on actual consumption
  - Helps optimize resource utilization 1:12



### Additional Important Characteristics

1. **Multi-tenancy**  - Multiple customers share the same physical infrastructure
  - Each tenant's data remains isolated and secure
  - Reduces costs through shared resources 1:8


2. **Resiliency and Availability**  - Built-in redundancy across multiple data centers
  - Automatic distribution of workloads across availability zones
  - Minimizes downtime risk 1:13


3. **Security**  - Advanced security measures implemented by providers
  - Shared responsibility model between provider and customer
  - Regular security updates and monitoring 1:14


4. **Flexible Pricing Models**  - Shifts IT spending from CapEx to OpEx
  - Per-second billing options available
  - Various pricing plans including long-term commitments 1:11


5. **Sustainability**  - Energy-efficient data centers
  - Reduced environmental impact through resource sharing
  - Enables remote work and reduces transportation emissions 1:15



These characteristics combine to create a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective computing environment that has become essential for modern businesses and organizations.
