Marshallling and unmarshalling of arguments in RMI involve converting objects into a format that can be transmitted over a network and reconstructing those objects on the receiving end. Here are the key points about marshalling/unmarshalling in RMI:

### Marshallling and Unmarshalling in RMI

1. Marshalling:
   - Converts objects into a stream of bytes
   - Allows objects to be passed as parameters or returned as results in RMI calls
   - Uses Java's serialization mechanism under the hood

2. Unmarshalling:
   - Reconstructs the original objects from the byte stream
   - Occurs on the receiver side after receiving the marshalled data

### Key Points

- All objects passed between RMI peers must be serializable
- Non-serializable objects cannot be marshalled/unmarshalled
- Custom serialization is possible but not recommended unless absolutely necessary
- Marshalling adds overhead compared to passing primitive types directly

### Differences Between COBRA and RMI

1. Protocol:
   - CORBA uses IIOP (Internet Inter-ORB Protocol)
   - RMI uses Java-specific protocols like JRMP (Java Remote Method Protocol)

2. Language Support:
   - CORBA supports multiple languages
   - RMI is Java-specific

3. Object Model:
   - CORBA uses IDL (Interface Definition Language)
   - RMI uses Java interfaces

4. Serialization:
   - CORBA has its own serialization mechanism
   - RMI uses Java's built-in serialization

5. Portability:
   - CORBA aims for greater cross-platform compatibility
   - RMI is primarily designed for Java-to-Java communication

6. Performance:
   - RMI generally has better performance due to its simpler protocol

7. Complexity:
   - RMI is simpler to implement and use within the Java ecosystem
   - CORBA offers more advanced features but is more complex to set up

8. Scalability:
   - Both support distributed systems, but CORBA may offer advantages in very large-scale deployments

### Best Practices

1. Ensure all objects passed between peers are serializable
2. Be cautious with circular references in object graphs
3. Use lightweight objects when possible to minimize marshalling overhead
4. Consider alternatives like Hessian or Kryo for high-performance scenarios

In summary, while both CORBA and RMI handle remote method invocation, they differ significantly in their underlying technologies, language support, and complexity levels. RMI is generally preferred for Java-to-Java communication within enterprise environments, while CORBA offers broader interoperability across different platforms and languages.
