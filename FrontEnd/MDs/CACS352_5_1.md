Distributed systems come in various forms, each with its own characteristics and applications. Here's an overview of different types of distributed systems:

1. Client/Server Systems:
   - Centralized server manages resources
   - Clients request services from the server
   - Examples: Web servers, file servers

2. Peer-to-Peer Systems:
   - All nodes act as both clients and servers
   - Resources are shared equally among participants
   - Examples: BitTorrent, Skype

3. Clustered Systems:
   - Group of computers work together as a single system
   - Shared storage and resource management
   - Examples: High-performance computing clusters, load-balanced web servers

4. Distributed Databases:
   - Data spread across multiple sites
   - Queries executed across distributed data
   - Examples: Google's BigTable, Amazon S3

5. Grid Computing Systems:
   - Large-scale network of computers sharing resources
   - Used for complex scientific computations
   - Example: SETI@home for radio signal detection

6. Cloud Computing Systems:
   - On-demand access to computing resources via internet
   - Pay-per-use model
   - Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform

7. Mobile Ad-hoc Networks:
   - Temporary networks formed by mobile devices
   - No fixed infrastructure
   - Examples: Bluetooth networks, Wi-Fi Direct

8. Sensor Networks:
   - Distributed collection of sensors monitoring environment
   - Self-organizing and adaptive
   - Examples: Weather monitoring systems, industrial automation

Key characteristics:
- Scalability
- Fault tolerance
- Security
- Performance
- Resource management

Best practices:
- Design for fault tolerance and high availability
- Implement proper security measures
- Optimize communication protocols
- Consider scalability requirements

Each type of distributed system has its strengths and is suited for specific applications. The choice depends on the particular requirements of the system being designed.
