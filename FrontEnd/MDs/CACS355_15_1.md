Here's a server-side program for the daytime service using sockets:

### Step-by-step thought process:

1. We'll create a server that listens for incoming connections on a specific port.
2. When a connection is established, we'll send the current date and time to the client.
3. We'll use the `ServerSocket` class to listen for incoming connections.
4. We'll use the `Socket` class to accept connections and communicate with clients.
5. We'll use `DataOutputStream` to send data to the client.
6. We'll close the sockets properly to release resources.

### Key points to consider:

- The daytime service typically uses port 13.
- We need to handle potential exceptions during socket operations.
- The server should continue listening for new connections after sending data to a client.

### Code implementation:

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class DaytimeServer {
    private static final int PORT = 13;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT);
             Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
             OutputStream outStream = socket.getOutputStream();
             PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(outStream, true);
             InputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();
             BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream))) {

            String currentTime = new java.util.Date().toString();
            out.println(currentTime);

            System.out.println("Sent: " + currentTime);

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Summary and best practices:

This program creates a server that listens for incoming connections on port 13 (the standard port for the daytime service). Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. It creates a `ServerSocket` on port 13.
2. It accepts an incoming connection using `accept()`.
3. It sets up output and input streams for communication.
4. It gets the current date and time using `new java.util.Date().toString()`.
5. It sends the current time to the client using `out.println()`.
6. It closes all resources properly using try-with-resources.

Best practices followed:
- Using try-with-resources to ensure proper closing of resources.
- Using constants for the port number.
- Handling potential IOExceptions.
- Printing the sent data for verification.

This server-side program implements the daytime service, which responds to client requests with the current date and time. Clients can connect to this server on port 13 to receive the current time.
