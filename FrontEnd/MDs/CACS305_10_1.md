The transformation from window coordinates to viewport coordinates involves mapping the coordinates of a point in the window space to the corresponding coordinates in the viewport space. This transformation is crucial for rendering graphics in a window that is different in size from the viewport.

Given a window bordered by (0,0) at the lower left and (4,4) at the upper right, and a viewport bordered by (0,0) at the lower left and (2,2) at the upper right, the transformation can be derived as follows:

### Step 1: Define the Transformation

The transformation from window coordinates (wx, wy) to viewport coordinates (vx, vy) can be defined by the following equations:

```
vx = (wx - window_left) * (viewport_width / window_width) + viewport_left
vy = (wy - window_bottom) * (viewport_height / window_height) + viewport_bottom
```

Here, `window_left`, `window_bottom`, `window_width`, and `window_height` are the coordinates and dimensions of the window, and `viewport_left`, `viewport_bottom`, `viewport_width`, and `viewport_height` are the coordinates and dimensions of the viewport.

### Step 2: Calculate the Transformation Parameters

Given the window is bordered by (0,0) at the lower left and (4,4) at the upper right, and the viewport is bordered by (0,0) at the lower left and (2,2) at the upper right, we can calculate the transformation parameters as follows:

- `window_left = 0`
- `window_bottom = 0`
- `window_width = 4`
- `window_height = 4`
- `viewport_left = 0`
- `viewport_bottom = 0`
- `viewport_width = 2`
- `viewport_height = 2`

### Step 3: Apply the Transformation to a Point

Given a window position (2,4) that is to be mapped into the viewport, we apply the transformation:

```
vx = (2 - 0) * (2 / 4) + 0 = 1
vy = (4 - 0) * (2 / 4) + 0 = 2
```

### Conclusion

The position of the viewport to maintain the same relative placement as in the window for a window position of (2,4) is (1,2). This means that the point (2,4) in the window space corresponds to the point (1,2) in the viewport space, maintaining the same relative position.
