![Total effect, substitution effect and income effect](/AskNerus/FrontEnd/Images/CAEC353_4_1_1.png)
The price effect is indeed the combination of income and substitution effects. Let me explain this concept in detail:

### Definition of Price Effect

The price effect refers to the total change in quantity demanded of a good or service in response to a change in its price, holding all other factors constant.

### Components of Price Effect

The price effect consists of two main components:

1. Income Effect
2. Substitution Effect

### Income Effect

The income effect arises because a price change changes a consumer's real income. 

Key points about the income effect:

- It occurs when the price change rotates the budget line, affecting the consumer's ability to purchase goods.
- For normal goods, an increase in price reduces real income, leading to decreased demand.
- For inferior goods, an increase in price actually increases real income, potentially leading to increased demand.

### Substitution Effect

The substitution effect occurs when consumers choose to consume more of the good with the lower price and less of the good with the higher price.

Key points about the substitution effect:

- It happens when the budget line is shifted parallel to itself, keeping the same slope.
- Consumers move along the indifference curve to reach a new equilibrium.
- It's responsible for the downward-sloping demand curve in many cases.

### Combining Income and Substitution Effects

The total price effect is the sum of the income effect and the substitution effect. These effects can work together or against each other depending on whether the good is normal or inferior.

For normal goods:
- Both effects tend to reduce quantity demanded when price increases
- Both effects tend to increase quantity demanded when price decreases

For inferior goods:
- The income effect works in the opposite direction of the substitution effect
- The net effect depends on which effect is stronger

### Graphical Representation

The price effect can be illustrated graphically using indifference curves and budget lines. By comparing the initial equilibrium point with the new equilibrium point after a price change, we can observe both the income and substitution effects separately and combined.

In conclusion, understanding the price effect as the combination of income and substitution effects provides valuable insights into how consumers respond to price changes and helps explain various economic phenomena, such as the shape of demand curves and consumer behavior in different market conditions.
