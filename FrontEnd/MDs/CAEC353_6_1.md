In a perfectly competitive market, both price and output are determined differently in the short run compared to the long run. Let's examine how they are determined in each case:

### Short Run Price and Output Determination

1. Price Determination:
   - The price is determined by the intersection of industry demand and supply curves.
   - All firms are price-takers and must accept this market price.
   - The price remains constant regardless of the firm's output decision.

2. Output Determination:
   - Each firm determines its own output level based on its own costs and technology.
   - Firms produce until Marginal Revenue (MR) equals Marginal Cost (MC).
   - This occurs where the firm's MR curve intersects its MC curve.

3. Equilibrium Conditions:
   - For the industry to be in equilibrium, the quantity demanded must equal the quantity supplied.
   - Individual firms aim to maximize profits, but the market price constrains them.

### Long Run Price and Output Determination

1. Price Determination:
   - The price remains constant and is determined by the industry's long-run equilibrium.
   - Entry and exit of firms based on profitability ensures that the market clears.

2. Output Determination:
   - In the long run, firms can adjust their inputs and outputs.
   - Firms continue to produce where MR = MC.
   - However, the long-run equilibrium may differ from the short-run due to entry and exit of firms.

3. Long-Run Adjustment Process:
   - Firms earn supernormal profits in the short run.
   - New firms enter the market, increasing supply and driving price down.
   - Existing firms exit if they cannot cover costs.

4. Long-Run Equilibrium:
   - Eventually, the industry reaches a state where all firms earn normal profits.
   - Price and output levels stabilize as entry equals exit.

### Key Differences Between Short Run and Long Run

1. Price Stability:
   - Short run: Price remains constant regardless of firm decisions.
   - Long run: Price adjusts based on entry and exit of firms.

2. Output Flexibility:
   - Short run: Firm output is constrained by fixed factors.
   - Long run: Full adjustment of inputs allows for optimal output.

3. Profitability:
   - Short run: Possible excess profits or losses.
   - Long run: Normal profits ensure long-term survival.

In conclusion, under perfect competition, both price and output are determined differently in the short run compared to the long run. The short run focuses on individual firm behavior within a given market structure, while the long run sees adjustments in the market itself through entry and exit of firms, leading to a more stable equilibrium.
