The diagram above illustrates the five-stage maturity progression, where each stage represents increasing sophistication in digital governance capabilities. The arrows labeled "Progress" indicate the natural evolution path, with organizations typically advancing through stages as their capabilities mature. Each stage builds upon the previous one, with components becoming increasingly integrated and sophisticated.

### Detailed Stage Descriptions

1. **Closed Stage**  - No digital presence
  - Traditional paper-based systems
  - Limited public access to information
  - Example: Manual land registration processes in rural Nepal


2. **Initial Stage**  - Basic website presence
  - Static information available
  - One-way communication channels
  - Example: Government department websites listing contact details and office hours


3. **Planned Stage**  - Strategic planning for digital transformation
  - Development of policies and frameworks
  - Infrastructure preparation
  - Example: Nepal's ICT policy development initiatives 0:0


4. **Realized Stage**  - Implementation of digital services
  - Integration across departments
  - Regular updates and maintenance
  - Example: Online tax payment systems in major cities


5. **Industrialized Stage**  - Fully automated processes
  - Advanced security measures
  - Continuous improvement cycles
  - Example: Integrated citizen service portals with mobile accessibility



### Current Challenges in Nepal

1. **Technical Challenges**  - Limited infrastructure for effective technology utilization 0:0
  - Outdated email systems and weak cybersecurity measures
  - Reliance on foreign solutions leading to inefficiencies


2. **Human Resource Issues**  - Brain drain affecting skilled manpower retention 0:0
  - Lack of local expertise in areas like cybersecurity
  - Need for continuous training programs


3. **Collaboration Needs**  - Multi-sector collaboration required 0:1
  - Integration between government agencies
  - Private sector involvement necessary
