The diagram above illustrates the four key dimensions of the Comparative Analysis Model, with each dimension building upon the previous one. The solid arrows show the sequential progression, while the dotted line represents the continuous feedback loop that helps improve technical initiatives based on economic outcomes.

### Components of Comparative Analysis Model

1. **Technical Dimension**  - Infrastructure Assessment: Evaluating existing technology infrastructure
  - Security Analysis: Examining security measures and protocols
  - Integration Evaluation: Assessing system integration capabilities


2. **Organizational Dimension**  - Policy Framework: Analyzing existing policies and regulations
  - Process Assessment: Evaluating operational procedures
  - Standards Compliance: Reviewing adherence to standards


3. **Social Dimension**  - Awareness Levels: Measuring public awareness of digital services
  - Acceptance Rates: Evaluating adoption rates among citizens
  - Participation Metrics: Assessing active engagement levels


4. **Economic Dimension**  - Investment Analysis: Evaluating resource allocation
  - ROI Assessment: Measuring return on investment
  - Sustainability Review: Assessing long-term viability



### Nepal's Current State Analysis

1. **Technical Assessment**  - Limited infrastructure for effective technology utilization 0:0
  - Outdated email systems and weak cybersecurity measures
  - Reliance on foreign solutions leading to inefficiencies


2. **Organizational Evaluation**  - Multi-sector collaboration requirements 0:1
  - Need for standardized processes
  - Policy development initiatives


3. **Social Analysis**  - Digital literacy gaps
