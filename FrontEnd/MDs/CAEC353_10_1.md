Based on the given data, let's calculate the requested national income measures:

a) GDP<sub>MP</sub> by using income method and expenditure method:

Income Method:
GDP<sub>MP</sub> = Compensation of employees + Mixed income of self-employed + Net property income from rents and dividends + Net interest + Depreciation + NFIA
GDP<sub>MP</sub> = 26726 + 32224 + 0 + 0 + 4434 + (-568) = 51216 crores

Expenditure Method:
GDP<sub>MP</sub> = Private final consumption expenditure + Government's final consumption expenditure + Gross fixed capital formation + Mixed income of self-employed + Net exports
GDP<sub>MP</sub> = 58326 + 7602 + 12610 + 32224 + (3542 - 3632) = 51216 crores

Both methods yield the same result: GDP<sub>MP</sub> = 51,216 crores

b) GDP<sub>FC</sub> and GNP<sub>MP</sub>

GDP<sub>FC</sub> = GDP<sub>MP</sub> - Indirect taxes + Subsidies
GDP<sub>FC</sub> = 51216 - 7728 + 674 = 43362 crores

GNP<sub>MP</sub> = GDP<sub>MP</sub> + Net factor income from abroad
GNP<sub>MP</sub> = 51216 + (-568) = 50648 crores

c) NNP<sub>FC</sub> and NNP<sub>MP</sub>

NNP<sub>FC</sub> = GDP<sub>FC</sub> + Net factor income from abroad
NNP<sub>FC</sub> = 43362 + (-568) = 42794 crores

NNP<sub>MP</sub> = NNP<sub>FC</sub> + Depreciation
NNP<sub>MP</sub> = 42794 + 4434 = 47228 crores

Key points to note:
1. The income method and expenditure method yield the same result for GDP<sub>MP</sub>.
2. GNP<sub>MP</sub> is higher than GDP<sub>MP</sub> due to net factor income from abroad.
3. NNP<sub>FC</sub> accounts for the cost of factors of production, excluding indirect taxes and including depreciation.
4. NNP<sub>MP</sub> adds back depreciation to get the final value of goods and services produced domestically and internationally.

These calculations demonstrate the relationship between different measures of national income and highlight the importance of considering both market price and factor cost in economic analysis.
