Here's an explanation of the Price Effect with a numerical example:

### Definition of Price Effect

The Price Effect refers to the change in quantity demanded of a good resulting from a change in its price, while keeping other factors constant. It's a fundamental concept in microeconomics that helps explain how price changes affect consumer behavior and market outcomes.

### Components of Price Effect

The Price Effect consists of two main components:

1. Substitution Effect
2. Income Effect

### Numerical Example

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the Price Effect:

Suppose John is choosing between buying baseball bats and cameras. Initially, he has $100 to spend per week.

Original prices:
- Baseball bat: $50
- Camera: $80

Original quantities consumed:
- 2 baseball bats ($100 / $50 = 2)
- 1 camera ($100 / $80 = 1.25)

Now, let's analyze the price change:

1. Substitution Effect:
   - When the price of baseball bats increases to $60, John wants to substitute towards cameras.
   - New quantities consumed:
     - 1.67 baseball bats ($100 / $60 ≈ 1.67)
     - 0.83 camera ($100 / $80 = 1.25)

2. Income Effect:
   - With the higher price of baseball bats, John's income for buying bats decreases.
   - He has less money to spend on either good.

3. Total Price Effect:
   - After accounting for both effects, John ends up consuming:
     - 1.33 baseball bats
     - 1 camera

### Explanation

1. Substitution Effect:
   - When the price of baseball bats increases, John wants to buy more cameras relative to bats.
   - However, his overall consumption of both goods combined remains the same.

2. Income Effect:
   - The higher price of bats reduces John's ability to purchase bats.
   - This leads to a decrease in total consumption of both goods.

3. Net Result:
   - The substitution effect tends to increase bat consumption.
   - The income effect tends to decrease bat consumption.
   - In this case, the income effect dominates, resulting in a net decrease in bat consumption.

### Importance of Price Effect Analysis

Understanding the Price Effect is crucial because:

- It helps businesses predict how changes in prices will affect demand for their products.
- It aids policymakers in designing tax policies and subsidies.
- It informs consumers about how price changes might influence their purchasing decisions.

By analyzing the Price Effect, economists can gain insights into consumer behavior and market dynamics, ultimately contributing to better decision-making in various economic contexts.
