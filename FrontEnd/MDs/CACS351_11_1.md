Here's a step-by-step guide on creating an Android Virtual Device (AVD) and running an application on the emulator:

### Creating an AVD

1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to Tools > Device Manager
3. Click on the "+" button to create a new AVD
4. Fill out the AVD details:
   - Name: Choose a unique name for your AVD
   - Target: Select the Android version you want to emulate
   - Skin: Choose a device skin (e.g., Nexus 5X, Pixel 3)
   - CPU/ABI: Select the CPU architecture (e.g., x86, ARM)
   - RAM: Set the desired RAM size
   - Internal Storage: Set the internal storage size
5. Click "Finish"

### Running Application on Emulator

1. Make sure your AVD is selected in the target device dropdown in the toolbar
2. Click the Run button (green play icon) or press Shift+F10
3. Gradle will build your project and install it on the emulator
4. The emulator will launch and your app will start running

Alternatively, you can run the emulator separately and then install and run your app:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the Android SDK tools directory
3. Run the emulator:
   ```
   emulator -avd <AVD_NAME>
   ```
4. Install your APK on the emulator:
   ```
   adb install <path_to_your_app.apk>
   ```
5. Run your app on the emulator:
   ```
   adb shell am start -n <package_name>/<activity_class>
   ```

Remember to replace `<AVD_NAME>`, `<path_to_your_app.apk>`, `<package_name>`, and `<activity_class>` with your actual values.

These steps provide a comprehensive guide to creating an AVD and running your Android application on the emulator.
