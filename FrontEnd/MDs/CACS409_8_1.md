Let's understand the differences between e-Government and e-Governance, and explore the stages of e-governance development in Nepal's context.

### Understanding e-Government vs e-Governance

| --- | --- | --- |
| Focus | Government services and operations | Broader governance processes |
| Scope | Limited to government-citizen interactions | Includes civil society and private sector |
