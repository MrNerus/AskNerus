This statement relates to the concept of consumer equilibrium and the idea of maximizing satisfaction. Let's break it down and justify it with a numerical example.

### Explanation

The statement suggests that a consumer can reach maximum satisfaction when the Marginal Utility (MU) per unit of goods X and Y equals the Marginal Utility per unit of money spent (MU_m). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

MU_X = MU_Y = MU_m

Where:
- MU_X is the Marginal Utility of good X
- MU_Y is the Marginal Utility of good Y
- MU_m is the Marginal Utility of money

### Justification with Numerical Example

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate this concept:

Suppose John has $100 to spend on two goods: Pizza (X) and Movie Tickets (Y).

Initial prices:
- Pizza: $5 per slice
- Movie Ticket: $10 per ticket

Initial quantities consumed:
- Pizza: 20 slices ($100 / $5 = 20)
- Movie Tickets: 10 tickets ($100 / $10 = 10)

Now, let's analyze John's utility:

1. Utility from Pizza:
   - First slice: 10 units
   - Second slice: 8 units
   - Third slice: 6 units
   ...
   - 20th slice: 0 units

2. Utility from Movie Tickets:
   - First ticket: 15 units
   - Second ticket: 12 units
   - Third ticket: 9 units
   ...
   - 10th ticket: 0 units

3. Total utility:
   - From Pizza: 10 + 8 + ... + 0 = 100 units
   - From Movies: 15 + 12 + ... + 0 = 90 units
   - Total utility: 190 units

Now, let's say John decides to spend his money differently:

1. Spend $80 on Pizza ($4 per slice):
   - Quantity consumed: 16 slices
   - Remaining money: $20

2. Spend $20 on Movie Tickets ($10 per ticket):
   - Quantity consumed: 2 tickets

Utility calculation:
- From Pizza: 10 + 8 + ... + 0 + 4 + 2 = 124 units
- From Movies: 15 + 12 = 27 units
- Total utility: 151 units

### Analysis

1. Initial equilibrium:
   - MU_X = MU_Y = MU_m
   - Maximum satisfaction achieved

2. New allocation:
   - MU_Pizza > MU_Movies
   - Total utility increases

### Conclusion

In this example, John initially achieves maximum satisfaction when MU_Pizza = MU_Movies = MU_m. When he reallocates his money, he gets more utility than before, but he doesn't reach the same level of satisfaction as in the initial equilibrium.

This illustrates that while reallocation might increase total utility, it doesn't necessarily lead to the highest satisfaction possible within the budget constraint. The statement suggests that the consumer reaches maximum satisfaction when the marginal utilities of goods equal the marginal utility of money, which aligns with the concept of optimal allocation of resources within a given budget.

It's worth noting that this approach assumes constant marginal utilities, which isn't always realistic. In reality, marginal utilities often decrease as consumption increases, leading to diminishing returns. However, the principle remains valid as a theoretical foundation for understanding consumer behavior and decision-making processes.
