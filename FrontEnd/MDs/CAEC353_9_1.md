Based on the table provided, let's address the questions step by step:

a) Plotting the TFC, TVC, and Total Cost (TC) curves:

1. TFC (Total Fixed Cost) curve:
   - Starts at 30 when output is 0
   - Remains constant at 30 for all positive outputs

2. TVC (Total Variable Cost) curve:
   - Starts at 0 when output is 0
   - Increases by 20 when output increases to 1
   - Increases by 10 when output increases to 2
   - Increases by 18 when output increases to 3
   - Increases by 72 when output increases to 4
   - Increases by 70 when output increases to 5

3. TC (Total Cost) curve:
   - Starts at 30 when output is 0
   - Increases by 20 when output increases to 1
   - Increases by 10 when output increases to 2
   - Increases by 18 when output increases to 3
   - Increases by 72 when output increases to 4
   - Increases by 80 when output increases to 5

b) Reason for the shape of the short run total cost curve:

The short run total cost curve has a U-shaped (or inverted U-shaped) curve due to the interaction between fixed and variable costs:

1. At low levels of output, fixed costs dominate, so TC rises rapidly.
2. As output increases, variable costs rise more slowly than fixed costs.
3. Beyond some point, the marginal cost of producing one more unit exceeds the average cost, causing TC to rise again.

This U-shape is characteristic of the short run because it reflects the trade-off between fixed costs (which don't change in the short run) and variable costs (which increase with output).

c) Calculating AFC, AVC, ATC, and MC:

1. AFC (Average Fixed Cost):
   - AFC = TFC / Quantity
   - Example: When output is 3, AFC = 78 / 3 = 26

2. AVC (Average Variable Cost):
   - AVC = TVC / Quantity
   - Example: When output is 3, AVC = 48 / 3 = 16

3. ATC (Average Total Cost):
   - ATC = TC / Quantity
   - Example: When output is 3, ATC = 78 / 3 = 26

4. MC (Marginal Cost):
   - MC = Change in TC / Change in Quantity
   - Example: From output 3 to 4, MC = (120 - 78) / (4 - 3) = 42

Note: These calculations can be done for any given output level in the table.

In conclusion, the short run total cost curve exhibits a U-shape due to the interplay between fixed and variable costs, reflecting the nature of production in the short run where some inputs are fixed.
