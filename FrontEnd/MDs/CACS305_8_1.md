The Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) line drawing algorithm is a method used in computer graphics to draw a line between two points. It works by calculating the slope of the line and then incrementally stepping through the pixels along the line, adjusting the x and y coordinates based on the slope. The DDA algorithm is particularly useful for drawing lines with integer coordinates, as it avoids the need for floating-point arithmetic.

### Working Details of DDA Line Drawing Algorithm

1. **Calculate the Slope**: The slope of the line is calculated as `(y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)`. This gives the change in y for each step along the x-axis.

2. **Determine the Increment**: The increment for the x and y coordinates is determined based on the slope. If the slope is positive, the x-coordinate is incremented, and if the slope is negative, the y-coordinate is incremented.

3. **Draw the Line**: Starting from the first point `(x1, y1)`, the algorithm increments the x and y coordinates by the determined increments until it reaches the second point `(x2, y2)`. Each step along the line corresponds to a pixel that is drawn.

### Digitizing the Line with Endpoints (2,2) and (10,5)

Let's digitize the line with endpoints (2,2) and (10,5) using the DDA line drawing algorithm.

1. **Calculate the Slope**: The slope is `(5 - 2) / (10 - 2) = 3 / 8 = 0.375`.

2. **Determine the Increment**: Since the slope is positive, we increment the x-coordinate. The increment for x is 1, and the increment for y is `0.375`.

3. **Draw the Line**: Starting from `(2,2)`, we increment the x-coordinate by 1 and the y-coordinate by `0.375` until we reach `(10,5)`.

   - Initial point: `(2,2)`
   - After first step: `(3,2.375)`
   - After second step: `(4,2.75)`
   - After third step: `(5,3.125)`
   - After fourth step: `(6,3.5)`
   - After fifth step: `(7,3.875)`
   - After sixth step: `(8,4.25)`
   - After seventh step: `(9,4.625)`
   - After eighth step: `(10,5)`

### Note

The DDA algorithm is a simple and efficient method for line drawing, but it can introduce rounding errors due to the use of integer arithmetic. This can lead to lines that are slightly off from the ideal line. Bresenham's line algorithm, which is a variant of the DDA algorithm, addresses this issue by using a more sophisticated approach to determine the increments, resulting in lines that are more accurately drawn.

For the purpose of this explanation, we've used the DDA algorithm to illustrate the basic concept of line drawing. In practice, Bresenham's algorithm would be preferred for its accuracy and efficiency in drawing lines in computer graphics.
