The demand curve typically slopes downward from left to right, reflecting the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded. This phenomenon is primarily explained through the substitution effect and the income effect. Here’s a detailed explanation of each:

1. Substitution Effect
The substitution effect occurs when the price of a good changes, making it more or less expensive relative to other goods. When the price of a good decreases, it becomes cheaper compared to other products. Consumers are likely to substitute this now less expensive good for other goods that are relatively more expensive. For example, if the price of apples falls while the price of oranges remains constant, consumers might buy more apples instead of oranges. This shift in consumption increases the quantity demanded of the cheaper good, leading to a downward-sloping demand curve.

2. Income Effect
The income effect refers to the change in quantity demanded due to a change in the consumer’s real purchasing power. When the price of a good decreases, consumers effectively have more purchasing power with the same amount of money. This increased purchasing power means they can afford to buy more of the good, thereby increasing the quantity demanded. For instance, if the price of a movie ticket drops, consumers have more disposable income to spend on other goods or more movie tickets, leading to a higher quantity demanded of movie tickets.

Illustration with Example
Consider the case of a popular brand of coffee. If the price of this coffee decreases from $5 to $3 per cup, consumers will likely buy more coffee because:

Substitution Effect: The coffee is now cheaper compared to other beverages like tea or juice, prompting consumers to choose coffee over these alternatives.
Income Effect: With the price drop, consumers feel richer because their overall expenditure on coffee is reduced. They might use the saved money to purchase additional coffee or other goods.
Conclusion
In summary, the downward slope of the demand curve is a result of the substitution effect, where consumers replace more expensive goods with cheaper ones, and the income effect, where lower prices increase real purchasing power and hence the quantity demanded. These effects ensure that as prices fall, the quantity demanded rises, reflecting the negative relationship between price and quantity demanded on the demand curve. This fundamental concept in microeconomics helps explain consumer behavior and market dynamics.
