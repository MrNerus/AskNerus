Here are short notes on the topics you asked about:

a) Java Web Frameworks:

Java web frameworks provide structure and tools for building web applications using Java. Some popular ones include:

- Spring MVC: Part of the Spring framework ecosystem, known for its flexibility and powerful features.
- Struts: An older but still widely used framework for building enterprise-level web applications.
- Play Framework: Known for its fast development capabilities and RESTful API support.
- JSF (JavaServer Faces): Provides a standard approach to building user interfaces for web applications.
- Hibernate: Object-relational mapping (ORM) tool that simplifies database access.

These frameworks aim to simplify web development by providing abstractions for common tasks like routing, templating, database access, and more.

b) CORBA:

CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) is a distributed object computing paradigm developed by OMG (Object Management Group). Key points about CORBA include:

- It allows objects to communicate with each other regardless of the programming languages or operating systems they run on.
- CORBA uses the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP) for communication.
- It supports distributed transactions and security mechanisms.
- CORBA provides a standard way to locate and invoke remote objects.
- It separates the interface definition from the implementation, promoting loose coupling.

While CORBA is still used in some enterprise environments, it has largely been superseded by newer technologies like SOAP and REST for web services.

c) Bean Bound Property:

A bound property in JavaBeans is a property that notifies listeners when its value changes. Key aspects of bound properties include:

- They use the PropertyChangeSupport class to manage listeners.
- When a bound property changes, the bean sends a PropertyChangeEvent to registered listeners.
- They are part of the java.beans package.
- Bound properties enhance the ability of beans to participate in larger systems, particularly those built around reflection.

Example of implementing a bound property:

```java
private int width;
private final PropertyChangeSupport pcs = new PropertyChangeSupport(this);

public int getWidth() {
    return width;
}

public void setWidth(int newValue) {
    int oldValue = width;
    width = newValue;
    pcs.firePropertyChange("width", oldValue, width);
}

public void addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {
    pcs.addPropertyChangeListener(listener);
}

public void removePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {
    pcs.removePropertyChangeListener(listener);
}
```

This implementation allows other parts of the application to register interest in changes to the width property and receive notifications when it changes.
