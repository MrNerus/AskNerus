Here's a program to perform basic two-way communication between client and server using sockets:

### Server Side (ServerTwoWayCommunication.java):

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class ServerTwoWayCommunication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8000);
             Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
             BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
             BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream()))) {

            System.out.println("Server connected");

            String message;
            while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println("Received from client: " + message);
                
                // Send response back to client
                out.write("Server received: " + message + "\n");
                out.flush();
            }

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Client Side (ClientTwoWayCommunication.java):

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class ClientTwoWayCommunication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 8000);
             BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream()));
             BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))) {

            System.out.println("Connected to server");

            String message;
            while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println("Received from server: " + message);
                
                // Send message to server
                out.write("Client says: " + message + "\n");
                out.flush();
            }

        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### How to run:

1. Compile both classes:
   ```
   javac ServerTwoWayCommunication.java
   javac ClientTwoWayCommunication.java
   ```

2. Run the server:
   ```
   java ServerTwoWayCommunication
   ```

3. Run the client:
   ```
   java ClientTwoWayCommunication
   ```

### Explanation:

1. Both server and client use try-with-resources to ensure proper closing of sockets and streams.

2. The server listens on port 8000 and accepts incoming connections.

3. The client connects to the server at localhost:8000.

4. Both sides use BufferedReader and BufferedWriter for reading and writing data.

5. The server reads messages from the client and prints them, then sends a response back.

6. The client reads messages from the server, prints them, and sends a response back.

7. This creates a continuous two-way communication loop.

This example demonstrates basic two-way communication between a client and a server using sockets. The server can send messages to the client, and the client can respond, creating a dialogue-like interaction.
