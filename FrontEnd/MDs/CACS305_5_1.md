To solve this problem, we'll use homogeneous transformation matrices. Homogeneous coordinates are a way of representing points and transformations in a 2D or 3D space using a 3D vector. The last coordinate is often set to 1 for points and 0 for transformations.

### Step 1: Convert Vertices to Homogeneous Coordinates

First, we convert the vertices of the triangle from Cartesian coordinates to homogeneous coordinates. For a point (x, y), its homogeneous coordinates are (x, y, 1).

- A(2,3) becomes A(2,3,1)
- B(5,5) becomes B(5,5,1)
- C(4,3) becomes C(4,3,1)

### Step 2: Define the Transformation Matrices

#### Rotation Matrix

To rotate a point 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin, we use the following rotation matrix:

```
R = | cos(90) -sin(90) 0 |
    | sin(90) cos(90) 0 |
    |   0        0     1 |
```

Since cos(90) = 0 and sin(90) = 1, the rotation matrix becomes:

```
R = |  0 -1 0 |
    |  1  0 0 |
    |  0  0 1 |
```

#### Translation Matrix

To translate a point by two units in each direction, we use the following translation matrix:

```
T = | 1 0 2 |
    | 0 1 2 |
    | 0 0 1 |
```

### Step 3: Apply the Transformations

To apply the transformations, we multiply the homogeneous coordinates of each vertex by the transformation matrices. The order of multiplication matters; we first rotate and then translate.

#### Rotation

- A(2,3,1) becomes A(R * A)
- B(5,5,1) becomes B(R * B)
- C(4,3,1) becomes C(R * C)

#### Translation

- A(2,3,1) becomes A(T * A)
- B(5,5,1) becomes B(T * B)
- C(4,3,1) becomes C(T * C)

### Step 4: Convert Back to Cartesian Coordinates

After applying the transformations, we convert the homogeneous coordinates back to Cartesian coordinates by dividing the x and y coordinates by the last coordinate (z).

### Final Step: Calculate the New Vertices

Let's calculate the new vertices:

#### Rotation

- A(2,3,1) becomes A(0,3,1) after rotation.
- B(5,5,1) becomes B(5,5,1) after rotation (since it's already aligned with the rotation axis).
- C(4,3,1) becomes C(4,3,1) after rotation (since it's already aligned with the rotation axis).

#### Translation

- A(0,3,1) becomes A(2,5,1) after translation.
- B(5,5,1) becomes B(7,7,1) after translation.
- C(4,3,1) becomes C(6,5,1) after translation.

### Final Vertices

- A'(2,5,1)
- B'(7,7,1)
- C'(6,5,1)

### Note

The above calculations assume that the rotation is performed around the origin (0,0) and that the translation is applied after the rotation. The actual transformation process involves matrix multiplication, which is not shown in detail here. In practice, you would use a programming language or a graphics library that supports matrix operations to perform these calculations.
