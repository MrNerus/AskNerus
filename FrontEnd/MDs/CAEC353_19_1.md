Based on the information provided, I'll create a figure to illustrate the concept of price elasticity of demand as a combination of income effect and substitution effect. Here's a simplified diagram:

```
          Point E
         /      \
        /        \
       /          \
      /            \
     /              \
    /                \
   /                  \
  /                    \
 /                      \
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|_______________________|
           Point N
```

Explanation of the figure:

1. Original equilibrium (Point E):
   - Where the budget line (BL) is tangent to the indifference curve (IC1)
   - Represents the initial consumption point

2. Price increase:
   - New budget line (BL') rotates inward due to higher price

3. Substitution effect:
   - Movement from E to S along IC1
   - Consumers substitute towards cheaper good (camera) as price increases

4. Income effect:
   - Movement from S to N along BL'
   - Consumers have less purchasing power after price increase

5. New equilibrium (Point N):
   - Where the new budget line intersects a lower indifference curve (IC2)
   - Represents final consumption point after price change

Key points illustrated:

1. The total price effect (movement from E to N) combines both substitution and income effects.

2. The substitution effect (E to S) shows how consumers respond to relative prices.

3. The income effect (S to N) demonstrates how reduced purchasing power affects demand.

4. The net result (E to N) represents the overall price elasticity of demand.

This diagram visually demonstrates how price elasticity of demand arises from the combination of income and substitution effects, illustrating why it's not simply one or the other, but rather the interaction between them.
