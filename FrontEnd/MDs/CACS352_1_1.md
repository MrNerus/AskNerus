RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call. It's a protocol that allows a program to execute a procedure or function on another computer as if it were a local procedure call. Here's a brief explanation of the RPC process:

1. Client Request:
   - The client initiates the RPC by sending a request to the server.
   - The request includes the procedure name and parameters.

2. Marshaling:
   - The client packages the procedure name and parameters into a format understandable by the server.
   - This process is called marshaling.

3. Communication:
   - The client sends the marshaled data over a network connection to the server.
   - The communication typically occurs through sockets or HTTP requests.

4. Unmarshaling:
   - Upon receiving the request, the server unmarshals the data back into its original form.

5. Execution:
   - The server executes the requested procedure locally.

6. Result Return:
   - The server prepares the result of the procedure execution.
   - The result is marshaled again for transmission back to the client.

7. Response:
   - The server sends the marshaled result back to the client.
   - The client receives and unmarshals the result.

Key points:
- RPC allows distributed computing across different machines.
- It abstracts network communication, making remote procedure calls feel local.
- RPC handles serialization/deserialization of data automatically.

Best practices:
- Use standardized RPC protocols like XML-RPC or gRPC for interoperability.
- Implement proper error handling and timeouts.
- Consider security implications, especially for cross-machine calls.

RPC enables efficient communication between different systems, facilitating distributed computing and service-oriented architectures.
