Here's a program to display the socket information (address, port, local address, and local port):

### Step-by-step thought process:

1. We need to create a Socket object to demonstrate socket information.
2. We'll use the Socket constructor that takes both remote and local parameters.
3. After creating the socket, we'll extract and display the required information.
4. We'll handle potential exceptions during socket creation and operations.

### Key points to consider:

- The Socket class requires both remote and local parameters when constructing.
- We need to import necessary classes from java.net package.
- Error handling is crucial when working with network operations.

### Code implementation:

```java
import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.Socket;

public class SocketInfoExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create a socket
            InetAddress remoteAddress = InetAddress.getByName("www.example.com");
            int remotePort = 80; // HTTP port
            
            InetAddress localAddress = InetAddress.getLocalHost();
            int localPort = 0; // This will be filled in automatically

            Socket socket = new Socket(remoteAddress, remotePort, localAddress, localPort);

            System.out.println("Socket Information:");
            
            // Display remote address and port
            System.out.println("Remote Address: " + socket.getInetAddress());
            System.out.println("Remote Port: " + socket.getPort());

            // Display local address and port (automatically set)
            System.out.println("Local Address: " + socket.getLocalAddress());
            System.out.println("Local Port: " + socket.getLocalPort());

            // Close the socket
            socket.close();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Summary and best practices:

This program demonstrates how to create a Socket object and retrieve its information. Here's a summary of what it does:

1. It creates a Socket object specifying both remote and local parameters.
2. It uses `getInetAddress()` and `getPort()` to get the remote address and port.
3. It uses `getLocalAddress()` and `getLocalPort()` to get the local address and port.
4. The program handles potential exceptions using a try-catch block.

Best practices followed:
- Proper exception handling to manage potential errors.
- Using constants for well-known ports (e.g., HTTP port 80).
- Closing the socket after use to free resources.
- Using InetAddress for more flexible IP address handling.

This example provides a clear demonstration of how to work with sockets in Java and how to retrieve their configuration details.
