Based on the search results and my knowledge, here are the key properties of indifference curves:

1. Downward Slope: Indifference curves are always downward sloping. This means that as you move along an indifference curve from left to right, you are giving up more of one good to get the same level of utility.

2. Convex Shape: Indifference curves are typically convex to the origin. This means they bulge outward as they extend away from the origin.

3. Non-Intersection: No two indifference curves can ever intersect. If they did, it would violate the assumption of transitivity in preferences.

4. Higher Curves Represent Higher Utility: Curves plotted higher and farther to the right correspond to higher levels of utility.

5. Transitive Preferences: Points on different indifference curves are ranked in order of preference. If point A is preferred to point B, and point B is preferred to point C, then point A is preferred to point C.

6. Complete Preference Ranking: All points on an indifference curve are ranked equally preferred.

7. Diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS): Along any given indifference curve, the MRS diminishes as you move along the curve. This means that as you consume more of one good, you become less willing to give up the other good to maintain the same level of utility.

8. Origin: Indifference curves do not pass through the origin unless the utility function is linear.

9. Infinite Curves: There are infinitely many indifference curves passing through any given point.

10. Budget Constraint: The optimal choice for a consumer is typically where an indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint.

These properties of indifference curves allow economists to model consumer preferences and behavior in a graphical manner, providing insights into how consumers make choices between different goods and services.
