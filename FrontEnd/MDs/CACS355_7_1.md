Here are short notes on HTTP, RMI, and Secure Sockets:

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is a protocol used for transferring data over a network, particularly for web browsing. Key points:

- Request-response model
- Uses TCP/IP as underlying protocol
- Stateless communication
- Supports text-based and binary data
- Commonly used for web services, APIs, and mobile apps

### RMI (Remote Method Invocation)

RMI is a protocol that allows a program to execute a procedure or method on another object as if it were a local object. Key points:

- Enables distributed computing in Java
- Uses object serialization for marshaling data
- Supports remote object activation and passivation
- Can be secured using SSL/TLS
- Useful for creating distributed applications

### Secure Sockets

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are cryptographic protocols that provide end-to-end encryption for data transmitted over networks. Key points:

- Encrypts data in transit
- Authenticates the identities of communicating parties
- Prevents tampering and interception of data
- Widely used for securing web communications (HTTPS)
- Supports mutual authentication between client and server

These technologies play important roles in enabling secure and efficient communication in distributed systems and web applications.
