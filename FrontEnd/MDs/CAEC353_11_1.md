Microeconomics explores how individual agents (consumers and firms) make decisions regarding the allocation of their limited resources. Understanding micro dynamics involves examining how these decisions are influenced by various factors and how they interact within markets. Here's a structured overview to help with exam preparation:

### 1. Consumer Behavior
 - **Utility Theory:** 
Consumers aim to maximize their utility, which is a measure of satisfaction or pleasure. This is governed by the principle of diminishing marginal utility, which states that as consumption of a good increases, the additional satisfaction from consuming an additional unit decreases.

- **Budget Constraint:** Consumers have a limited budget and must make choices within this constraint. The budget line represents all combinations of goods that a consumer can afford.

- **Indifference Curves:** These curves represent combinations of goods that provide the same level of utility to the consumer. The consumerâ€™s optimal choice is where the budget line is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve.

### 2. Theory of Demand
- **Law of Demand:** As the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded generally increases, and vice versa, holding other factors constant.

- **Demand Curve:** A graphical representation showing the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded. It typically slopes downward due to the substitution and income effects.

- **Elasticity of Demand:** Measures how sensitive the quantity demanded is to changes in price (price elasticity), income (income elasticity), or the price of other goods (cross elasticity). Elasticity can be classified as elastic, inelastic, or unitary.

### 3. Theory of Supply
- **Law of Supply:** As the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied generally increases, and vice versa, holding other factors constant.

- **Supply Curve:** A graphical representation showing the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied. It typically slopes upward.

- **Elasticity of Supply:** Measures how sensitive the quantity supplied is to changes in price. Factors affecting supply elasticity include production technology, availability of resources, and time period.

### 4. Market Equilibrium
- **Equilibrium Price and Quantity:** The price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. At this price, there is no tendency for change unless external factors shift the supply or demand curves.

- **Shifts in Curves:** Changes in factors such as consumer preferences, income, or production costs can shift the demand or supply curves, leading to new equilibrium prices and quantities.

### 5. Market Structures
- **Perfect Competition:** Many firms sell identical products, and no single firm can influence the market price. Firms are price takers.

- **Monopolistic Competition:** Many firms sell similar but not identical products. Each firm has some control over its prices
