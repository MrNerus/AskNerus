Here's a multi-threaded TCP client and server socket program for daytime services in Java:

### Daytime Service Server

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class DaytimeServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8000);
            System.out.println("Daytime service server started on port 8000");

            while (true) {
                Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
                System.out.println("Connection accepted from " + socket.getInetAddress());

                Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
                    try {
                        InputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();
                        OutputStream outputStream = socket.getOutputStream();

                        // Send current time
                        Date currentDate = new Date();
                        byte[] currentTimeBytes = String.valueOf(currentDate).getBytes();
                        outputStream.write(currentTimeBytes);
                        outputStream.flush();

                        System.out.println("Current time sent to client: " + currentDate);
                    } catch (IOException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    } finally {
                        try {
                            socket.close();
                        } catch (IOException e) {
                            e.printStackTrace();
                        }
                    }
                });
                thread.start();
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Daytime Service Client

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class DaytimeClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 8000);
            System.out.println("Connected to daytime service server");

            InputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();
            byte[] buffer = new byte[1025];
            int bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer);

            String receivedTime = new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
            System.out.println("Received time from server: " + receivedTime);

            socket.close();
        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. Server Program:
   - Creates a `ServerSocket` listening on port 8000.
   - Uses a loop to accept incoming connections.
   - For each connection, creates a new thread to handle the client.
   - In the thread, sends the current date and time to the client.
   - Closes the socket after processing.

2. Client Program:
   - Connects to the server at localhost on port 8000.
   - Reads the time sent by the server.
   - Prints the received time.

### Key Points

1. Multithreading: The server uses separate threads for each client, allowing concurrent handling of multiple clients.

2. Daytime Service: Simulates a simple network service that returns the current date and time.

3. Socket Programming: Demonstrates basic TCP socket programming concepts.

4. Exception Handling: Includes basic exception handling for IO operations.

5. Connection Management: Properly closes sockets after use.

To run this program:
1. Compile both the server and client classes.
2. Run the server first.
3. Run the client to connect to the server.

Note: This is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you'd want to add more robust error handling, logging, and possibly implement a more sophisticated protocol for communication.
