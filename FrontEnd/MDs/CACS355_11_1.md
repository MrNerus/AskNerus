Here's an explanation of the Client-Server Model and the features of Java as a network programming language:

### Client-Server Model

The Client-Server Model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between providers of a resource or service (called servers) and service requesters (called clients). 

Key features of the Client-Server Model include:

- Separation of responsibilities: Clients initiate requests for services, while servers provide those services.

- Scalability: The model allows for easy expansion by adding more servers to handle increased load.

- Centralized management: Administrators can manage resources and services from a central location.

- Platform independence: Data exchange can occur using platform-agnostic protocols.

Common examples of the Client-Server Model include email systems, web browsing, and online banking.

### Features of Java as a Network Programming Language

Java offers several features that make it well-suited for network programming:

1. Built-in networking support: Java has built-in classes and methods for socket programming, allowing developers to create networked applications easily.

2. Multithreading: Java supports multithreading, enabling efficient handling of concurrent network connections.

3. Object-oriented: Java's object-oriented nature allows for modular and reusable network components.

4. Platform independence: Java bytecode can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), facilitating cross-platform network development.

5. Security: Java provides built-in security features like encryption and authentication, essential for secure network communications.

6. Extensive libraries: Java offers comprehensive libraries for various networking tasks, including HTTP, FTP, and TCP/IP.

7. Remote Method Invocation (RMI): Java's RMI allows for method invocation on remote objects, enabling distributed computing.

8. Socket programming: Java provides low-level socket programming capabilities for custom network protocols.

9. Serialization: Java's serialization feature allows for easy conversion of objects to byte streams, useful for transmitting data over networks.

10. Networking APIs: Java provides high-level APIs for common network protocols, simplifying network programming tasks.

These features make Java a robust choice for developing networked applications, from simple client-server interactions to complex distributed systems.
